# python_assignment
This repository is part of my learning journey to understand GitHub and version control. Through this project, I am exploring key GitHub workflows and concepts, including:

SSH Keys:
-Configuring SSH keys for secure access.

Repository Management:
-Creating a public repository named python_assignment.
-Adding a detailed README file explaining the purpose of the repository.
-Creating a .gitignore file to exclude Python-specific files (e.g., .pyc, __pycache__/).

Git Basics:
-Cloning the repository to my local machine.
-Adding and modifying files like sample.py.
-Committing changes with meaningful messages.
-Pushing updates to the remote repository.

Branching and Merging:
-Creating and switching between branches.
-Modifying files in branches to simulate and resolve merge conflicts.
-Merging branches into the main branch.

Pull Requests:
-Creating new branches and making changes.
-Pushing branches to the remote repository.
-Creating and reviewing pull requests.
-Merging pull requests after ensuring code quality.

Issue Tracking:
-Creating and resolving issues.
-commits to issues and closing them upon resolution.
-Setting up milestones for future enhancements (e.g., "version 2.0").
-This structured approach is helping me build a strong foundation in Git and GitHub while enhancing my understanding of version control systems.
